# Module 2 | Promo T: individual intermediate evaluation exercise



In this exercise we need to develope a game called "Dice and bets" 🎲🎲

The program generates a random number from the dice (from 1 to 6). 
In the game the user starts with a balance 50 euros to bet. 
The user could decide which number to bet on from 1 to 6, and also the amount of euros she wants to bet. 
If the user guesses the right number, she wins double the amount she has bet, if she does not guess the right number, she loses all the amount she has bet.
